Known Issues
Forkify API Behavior: The app uses the Forkify API, which pulls recipes from various external websites. As a result, when a user selects a recipe, they are redirected to an external website to view the full recipe details and ingredients.
This is not a bug, but a built-in behavior of the Forkify API.
